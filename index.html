Style transfer is a method of transferring the style of an image, like a painting,
to another image. This is useful for creating new types of computer generated
artwork, and it can even be used for videos. Our approach focuses on exploring
and optimizing the actual style transfer for videos, as well as the training of models
used for style transfer. We have found key areas
for improvement in the most popular style transfer algorithm currently in use
(shown in [1]) through our experiments and propose a modified structure for possible better performance, 
and faster training.

<!-- Motivation behind the problem you are solving, what applications it has,

existing problem, briefly mention and describe the existing approaches and tell

Style transfer algorithms produce very artistic and often seemingly imaginative
outputs, making it a very popular way to filter images and generate abstract
art. Tools like the <a href = "https://deepdreamgenerator.com/" target="_blank">Deep Dream Generator</a>
use style transfer algorithms to generate visual content for consumer use or
research purposes. Real-time style transfer can be used for augmented reality
applications and videos by applying the transformation frame-by-frame, but this
requires faster methods for determining how to transfer style.
<br><br>
The modern style transfer algorithm, introduced by Johnson et al., works as
shown in the following figure:

  <img style = "width: 46%; height:100%" src= "images/johnsonSTNetwork.png">
</div>
<h5 style = "text-align: center">Johnson et al. Style Tranfer Pipeline [1]</h5>

<br>

The algorithm is split up into two parts, an image transformation network (ITN) and a
loss network. The loss network is a pre-trained VGG16 network meant for
image classification, and it defines weighted functions of feature reconstruction
loss and style reconstruction loss. Most modern style transfer implementations
make use of the same loss network. The loss functions generated by the loss network
are used when training the image transformation network (ITN), and training the
ITN introduced in [1] involves fixing a style image and feeding through a large
database of content images. The ITN introduced by Johnson et al. incorporates a
convolutional neural network with multiple convolutional and pooling layers
throughout; however, other modern implementations use different approaches.
For example, the method introduced in [7] has an ITN that matches the mean
and variance of intermediate features, and the ITN in [8] uses a network that
attempts to minimize the difference of centered covariance between the loss
network output and the combined style and content images.
<br><br>
We approached the problem of style transfer by first taking into account what
currently exists, and then modifying and combining the traits present in each
method to try and achieve an algorithm better suited for modern, high-quality and
fast videos. Specifically, we attempted to make the videos created smoother and 
more pleasing to the eye. Additionally, we wanted to make the styling of images more
accessible. The largest barrier to this is the sheer time taken for training style models
as in [1]. We attempted to find ways to speed up this process as well.

  <h4>Part 1: Smoother Videos</h4>

  In order to create smoother videos, we decided to approach the problem using post processing rather than training. This is because the other major problem that we 
  are attempting to solve is the long training times we have encountered throughout the process. In this vein, there are several method through which we attempted to 
  improve the flickering effect of stylizing videos:
  <br><br>
  <ul>
    <li>Gaussian Filtering</li>
    <li>Interpolation of video (predicting frames between frames)</li>
    <li>Frame subtraction</li> 
  </ul>

  These attempted changes were what we thought had the best chance of success of making the videos smoother, and reduce the flickering effect.

    A first, rudimentary attempt to get a smoother video was to apply gaussian filtering to the images after passing through the stylization.
    This would ideally create a smoother intepretation of the background vs the fox, and would result in a more pleasing image. However,
    the reality was that this attempt did nothing to make the frames less jittery, and only sreved to blur the coloring in the videos.
    This makes sense, as gaussian filtering does nothing to take into account the way that the neural net styles images. This was when we
    first thought that the key to getting stable videos may lie in the actual training of the neural net, but regardless we pushed onwards to test the other
    theories we had.

  <h5>Interpolation of video (predicting frames between frames)</h5>

  </div>
  <br>
    This result was obtained by increasing the number of frames in the original video through
     frame interpolation and running the video with extra frames throught the transformation network. The 
     goal was that the extra frames might reduce or smooth the flickering between frames by reducing the difference 
     between frames and making the overall video seem less jumpy.
     This was successful to a degree. The flickering is smoother as there are smaller changes between frames, however, 
     there is still just as much flickering as there was in the original image.

      </figure>

    </div>

    <br>

    For this approach, we attempted to use the previous frame of the video to help make intelligent decisions about the next frame in the video.
    There were two main attempts to do this, as shown by the results in the left and right videos:
    <br><br>
    <ul>
            <li>Using unedited stylized frame as previous frame</li>
            <br>
            For this attempt, we created the first frame of the stylized video as normal. 
            Then, for every successive frame, we calculated the difference in pixel values 
            based on a threshold between the content frames in the original video. This can be 
            thought of as similar to background subtraction, but less complex. Next, we found the pixels
            that had changed from frame to frame, and overlayed the previous stylized frame on the current stylized frame where
            we determined that the frames had not changed. Finally, we set the last stylized frame to 
            the UNEDITED stylized frame. That is, the frame in the resulting video and the frame used
            as the previous frame are different, with the video containing a frame that contains both elements of the 
            previous frame and the stylized frame of the original video, and the frame used for reference in calculation
            being the non-overlayed stylized frame. This resulted in a fairly smooth video, with flickering that is slightly less noticable
            than in the original video. However, there is no marked improvement, and we continued on to the second approach.

            <br><br>
            <li>Using edited stylized frame as previous frame</li>
            <br>

            For this second attempt, we had some serious doubts. For example, when using the edited
            stylized frame as a reference point for future frame replacement, there is the danger of 
            compounding errors. For example, if a pixel is calculated as different between frames when in reality it 
            isn't, or the reverse, that error will be propogated throughout the whole video. To combat this, the threshold used
            to find difference is the mean of the difference matrix. This results in a video where the fox, the main source of
            movement, to be very well captured, while the background seems less consistent. This is because
            the background is less consistently found as "changed", and what few instances there are change for make for 
            and interesting "popping" effect


            
    </ul>
  
    <h4>Part 2: Training Time Improvements</h4>

    TODO: AUSTEN PLEASE WRITE ABOUT WHAT YOUR RESULTS WERE
<h2><u>Conclusions and Future Work</u></h2>
  <h4>Part 1: Smoother Videos</h4>

  As it turns out, none of our experiments were particularly successful. While the frame subtraction had the best chance of success, and had the best results,
  they did not markedly improve the style transfer for the video. Howver, we did stumble upon a possible plan that could work very well
  if we had had more time. During training of the neural net, there are three losses that are minimized: Content loss, style loss, and total variance loss. These
  combined are what make the balance between content and style in the produced images. However, with videos, another loss component can be added to try and minimize
  the effect of stylization between frames: noise loss. For example, different frames in a video contain only small difference, which can essentially be treated
  as noise. If, during training, we could calculate both the styled image with and without noise, and minimize the loss between those two images, the neural net would be
  much better suited to create stylized videos where there is less flickering between frames, as the background/non-moving portions of the frames would be more consistent.
  Unfortunately, due to time constraints and high training times, we could not test this implementation. However, we did work on reducing training times for style models,
  which would have helped us achieve this goal.
